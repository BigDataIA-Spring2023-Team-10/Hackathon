# Overview 📝

We have built a meeting intelligence application that reads an audio file, converts the audio into transcript using Whisper Api and then using GPT 3.5 Api, runs queries and asks questions related to the meeting. For frontend we have used Streamlit and scheduled tasks of reading audio, creating transcript and running default queries using Apache-Airflow.


# Process Outline

>1. We are creating a portal where a patient can login and thus the login entering the previous medical history to track the previous medical report

>2. The Symtoms suggested by the user and prompt with the suggestions.

>3. Read and convert audio to transcript using Whisper Api

>4. Pass the transcript along with related queries through GPT 3.5 API.

>5. Store user activity logs(Queries) into DB.
